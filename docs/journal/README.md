# Journal Directory

Purpose: record chronological events, decisions, or retrospectives for historical traceability.
Belongs: dated entries summarizing what happened, when, and why, without imposing new mandates.
Not allowed: forward-looking requirements, refined specs, or design decisions that belong elsewhere.
When a journal entry references other layers, cite docs/rules/document-lifecycle.md for the lifecycle rules.
