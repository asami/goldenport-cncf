# Development Journal — 2026 / 01

This directory is a **development journal** for January 2026.

It contains working documents created during ongoing development,
including intermediate reasoning, work plans, temporary decisions,
and drafts produced in collaboration with AI tools.

---

## Purpose

This journal exists to preserve **the process**, not just the results.

It captures:
- reasoning trails and design exploration
- work order decisions and dependency considerations
- false starts and rejected ideas
- temporary drafts (including Codex instruction drafts)
- context needed to resume work accurately at a later time

---

## Important Notes

- Files in this directory are **NOT canonical specifications or design documents**.
- Contents may be revised, summarized, reorganized, or partially removed over time.
- Deletion should be **intentional and reviewed**, not accidental.

Canonical documents live elsewhere:

- **Specifications**: `docs/spec/`
- **Design records**: `docs/design/`
- **Phase summaries**: `docs/notes/`

This journal must not be treated as an authoritative source.

---

## Relationship to Phases

Entries in this journal may reference:
- specific phases (e.g. Phase 2.8),
- work items (e.g. Work A1),
- or temporary decisions that later appear in official phase documents.

When a decision or design is finalized:
- it should be promoted to `docs/design/` or `docs/notes/`,
- and this journal should be updated to reference that promotion.

---

## Pruning and Summarization Policy

This journal is **kept by default**.

However, when it becomes too large or noisy:
- early entries may be **summarized and consolidated**,
- detailed drafts may be replaced with short summary documents
  (e.g. `2026-01-early-summary.md`).

The goal is to preserve **intent and reasoning**, not raw verbosity.

---

## Audience

This journal is written for:
- the future version of the author,
- AI agents resuming work,
- and maintainers who need historical context.

It is **not** intended as user-facing documentation or formal reporting.

---

## Status

- Nature: non-canonical, historical
- Retention: keep, but compress when appropriate
- Authority: informational only

## Phase 2.8 Context Re-architecture

- `runtime-context-consolidation.md` (Close Report 2026-01-18, CLOSED)
- `context-rearchitecture-freeze.md` (closed 2026-01-18)
- Follow-on work: System/Application/Domain context redefinition (OPEN)
