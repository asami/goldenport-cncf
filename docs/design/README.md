# Design Directory

Purpose: host immutable design decisions that explain boundaries, responsibilities, and intent.
Belongs: approved architecture notes, stable diagrams, and explanations that must not contradict rules or specs.
Not allowed: exploratory chatter, unvetted requirements, or implementation how-to material.
Refer to docs/rules/document-lifecycle.md for the expected flow from notes through design to spec.
