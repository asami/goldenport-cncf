# CNCF Development Strategy

## 1. Purpose of This Document
- Provide a shared, top-level strategy for growing CNCF in stages.
- Prevent scope drift by making phase boundaries explicit.
- Serve as the meta-context for future notes and design documents.
- This document covers strategy only; execution, verification, and results live in notes.

## 2. Development Philosophy
- Bootstrap first.
- Model before execution.
- Projection over adapter.
- Subsystem as a reusable execution unit.
- One execution model, multiple frontends (HTTP / CLI / Client).

## 3. Phase Overview

### Phase 1: HelloWorld Bootstrap
- Goal: no-setting startup guarantee.
- Artifact (notes): `docs/notes/helloworld-bootstrap.md`.
- Excluded: CRUD, CML, persistence, authentication.

### Phase 1.5: Subsystem Execution Model Fix (Internal)
- Goal: fix execution responsibilities.
- Artifact (notes): `docs/notes/helloworld-step2-subsystem-execution.md`.
- Internal design note, not a demo or article.

### Phase 2: HelloWorld Demo Strategy
- Goal: user-visible demo experience.
- Artifact (notes): `docs/notes/helloworld-demo-strategy.md`.
- Covers: server, OpenAPI, client, command, component demo.
- This phase exists to support a concrete demo article.

### Phase 2.5: Error Semantics Consolidation

**Goal**
Finalize and freeze the error / failure semantics of CNCF
before entering CML and CRUD-oriented development.

**Scope**
- Consolidate core-level semantics:
  - Observation
  - Conclusion
  - Cause / CauseKind
  - Detail error code strategy
- Define CNCF-level projections:
  - CLI exit code mapping
  - HTTP status mapping
  - Client-visible error representation

**Non-goals**
- No CML modeling
- No CRUD generation
- No workflow or job orchestration

**Rationale**
Error semantics must be completed before domain expansion.
CML and CRUD layers will rely on this frozen contract.

**Artifacts**
- CNCF note: `error-semantics.md`
- Core note: `core-error-semantics.md`
- Related design notes:
  - `docs/notes/scope-context-design.md`
  - `docs/notes/conclusion-observation-design.md`
  - `docs/notes/observability-engine-build-emit-design.md`

### Phase 2.6: Demo Completion on Frozen Platform

**Goal**
Complete remaining Phase 2.0 demo stages on top of frozen platform contracts.

**Scope**
- No platform contract changes:
  - Execution model
  - Error semantics
  - Observability semantics
  - ScopeContext model
- Complete demo stages:
  - OpenAPI projection
  - Client demo
  - Custom component demo
  - Demo consolidation

**Exit Criteria**
- See: `docs/notes/phase-2.6-demo-done-checklist.md`

**Relationship**
Phase 2.0 may be incomplete; Phase 2.6 completes it without re-opening
platform contracts. Phase 3 starts only after Phase 2.6 exit criteria are met.

- `docs/notes/helloworld-bootstrap.md`
- `docs/notes/phase-2.5-observability-overview.md`
- `docs/notes/interrupt-ticket.md`

### Phase 3: CML → CRUD Domain Subsystem
- Goal: domain modeling and runtime bootstrap.
- Not driven by demo requirements.
- Artifact (notes): `docs/notes/cml-crud-domain-subsystem-bootstrap.md`.

## 4. Relationship Between Phases
- Later phases depend on earlier phases.
- Phase 1.5 constrains Phase 2 and Phase 3.
- Execution model must not be changed by demo needs.

## 5. How to Read the Documents
- CNCF developers: use this strategy to sequence work.
- Demo/article authors: respect phase boundaries.
- AI assistants (Codex / ChatGPT): treat this as the top-level planning context.
- Notes contain execution details and results for each phase.

## 6. Explicit Non-Goals
- No skipping phases.
- No CRUD before demo foundation.
- No REST adapter explosion.
- No demo-driven architecture distortion.
