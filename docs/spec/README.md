# Spec Directory

Purpose: collect executable requirements, acceptance criteria, and references to rules.
Belongs: behavior specifications that are linked from tests or CI and that must be satisfied by the code.
Not allowed: conjecture, implementation details, or exploratory notes that have not reached spec status.
Always cross-check docs/rules/document-lifecycle.md before promoting a note or design into this directory.
